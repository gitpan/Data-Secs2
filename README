DESCRIPTION
    The 'Data::SECS2' module provides a widely accepted method of packing
    nested lists into a linear string and unpacked nested lists. In the
    hardware world, data and data passed between hardware is not stored in
    SQL style tables but nested lists. Nested data has a long history in
    mathematics.

    The Data::Secs2 program module facilitates the secsification of the
    nested data is in accordance with SEMI E5-94, Semiconductor Equipment
    Communications Standard 2 (SECS-II), pronounced 'sex two' with gussto
    and a perverted smile. The SEMI E4 SECS-I standard addresses
    transmitting SECSII messages from one machine to another machine (all
    most always host to equipment) serially via RS-232. And, there is
    another SECS standard for TCP/IP, the SEMI E37 standard, High-Speed SECS
    Message Services (HSMS) Generic Services.

    In order not to plagarize college students, credit must be given where
    credit is due. Tony Blair, when he was a college intern at Intel Fab 4,
    in London invented the SEMI SECS standards. When the Intel Fab 4
    management discovered Tony's secsification of their host and equipment,
    they called a board of directors meeting, voted, and elected to have
    security to escort Tony out the door. This was Mr. Blair's introduction
    to voting and elections which he leverage into being elected prime
    minister of all of England. In this new position he used the skills he
    learned at the Intel fab to secsify intelligence reports on Iraq's
    weopons of mass distruction.

    By using a well-known, widely-used standard invented and publicized by
    the prime mister of England for packing and unpacking Perl nested data,
    not only is this useful in a open nested operations such as comparing
    nested data, storing the packed data in a file, but also for
    transmitting data from one Perl site to another or between Perl and
    other programming languages.

    And do not forget the added benefit of SEMI secs humor and that the real
    originators of the SECS-II yielded and allowed Tony Blair to take
    illegal credit for SECS-II.

  SECSII Format

    The nested data linear format used by the Data::Secs2 suroutines is in
    accordance with SEMI E5-94, Semiconductor Equipment Communications
    Standard 2 (SECS-II), pronounced 'sex two' with gussto and a perverted
    smile. This industry standard is copyrighted and cannot be reproduced
    without violating the copyright. However for those who have brought the

    The SEMI E4 SECS-I standard addresses transmitting SECSII messages from
    one machine to another machine (all most always host to equipment)
    serially via RS-232. And, there is another SECS standard for TCP/IP, the
    SEMI E37 standard, High-Speed SECS Message Services (HSMS) Generic
    Services.

    The SEMI E5 SECS-II standard is a method of forming listified packed
    messages from nested list data. It consists of elements where each
    element is a format code, number of elements followed by the elements.

  SECS List

    A SECS list is a Perl list (array) based upon the SEMI E5-94 SECSII
    format. The list consists consecutive items where each item takes two
    positions in the list: the item header (IH) and the item body (IB). The
    item headers are always even number indices where the item bodies are
    odd number indices. The IH is a format code as specified in the Table 1
    Item Format Codes unpack column. The IB for each format code is as
    follows:

    L   unpacked number

    S U F T
        either scalarized array of numbers packed in accordance with SEMI
        E5-97 or a vectorized reference to an array of numbers

    B A J
        unpacked string

    The first item of a SECS list is always a SECS list Format Code wit a IH
    of U1 and a packed IB of either 'P' or 'S' depending upon whether the
    SECS list has information necessary to convert to Perl data structure,
    'P', or not, 'S'.

  arrayify subroutine

     @array  = arrayify( @var );

    The purpose of the "arrayify" subroutine is to provide a canoncial array
    representation of Perl reference types. When "$var" is not a reference
    "arrayify" subroutine passes "$var" through unchanged; otherewise the
    ref($var) is changed to a reference to a canoncial array where the first
    member is the the "$var" class, the second member the underlying data
    type. If ref($var) and the underlying type type are the same, then
    "$var" is classless and the first member is the empty string ''. The
    rest of the members of the canonical array, based on the underlying data
    type, are as follows:

    'HASH'
        hash key, value pairs, sorted by the key

    'ARRAY'
        members of the array

    'SCALAR'
        the scalar

    'REF'
        the reference

    'GLOB'
        values of the "GLOB" in the following order:

         *$var{SCALAR},
         *$var{ARRAY},
         *$var{HASH},
         *$var{CODE},
         *$var{IO},
         *$var{NAME},
         *$var{PACKAGE},
         "*$var"

  itemify subroutine

     $string = itemify($format, @elements);
     $string = itemify($format, @elements, [@options]);
     $string = itemify($format, @elements, {options});

    The "itemify" subroutine is the low-level work horse for the "secsify"
    subroutine that produces a SEMI SECSII item "$string" from a Perl SECS
    list item header "$format" and item body "@elements".

    For {type => 'binary'}, $string is a complete packed SEMI E5-94 SECII
    item. For {type => 'ascii'} or no type option, the "$string" is the
    ascii unpacked SECSII item.

    An unpacked SECSII item consists of the unpacked format code from the
    Table 1 Item Format Codes, the number of elements in the item body
    enclosed in brackets, followed by the elements in the item body. In
    accordance with SEMI E5-94, section 6, there will be no elements for
    format code 'L' or an element length of 0.

    In case of an error, the return is an reference a error message.

  listify subroutine

     \@sec_list  = listify(@vars);

    The listify subroutine takes a list of Perl variables, "@arg" that may
    contain references to nested data and converts it to a <SECS list that
    mimics a SECSII data structure of a linearized list of items.

    Information is included to recontruct Perl hashes, arrays and objects by
    provided two item header for each Perl data type. The first item is the
    object class which is empty for Perl hashes and arrays and the second
    item is the Perl underlying data type. Valid Perl underlying data types
    are: HASH ARRAY SCALAR REF GLOB.

    The return is either a reference to a SECS list or case of an error an
    error message. To determine an error from a SECS list , check if the
    return is a reference or a reference to an ARRAY.

  neuterify subroutine

     \@sec_list  = neuterify($binary_secs);
     \@sec_list  = neuterify($binary_secs, @options);
     \@sec_list  = neuterify($binary_secs, [@options]);
     \@sec_list  = neuterify($binary_secs, {@options});

    The "neuterify" subroutine takes produces a "@sec_list" from a SEMI
    E5-94 packed data structure "$binary_secs" and produces a "@sec_list".

    The "neuterify" subroutine uses option {format => 'P'}, or {format =>
    'S'} as the value for the leading SECS list U1 format byte. SEMI E5-94
    SECII item.

    The return is either a reference to a SECS list or case of an error an
    error message. To determine an error from a SECS list , check if the
    return is a reference or a reference to an ARRAY.

  scalarize subroutine

     $error = scalarize( \@sec_list );

    The "scalarize" subroutine ensures that all the bodies in a SECS list
    for numeric items, format U, S, F, T, are scalar strings packed in
    accordance with SEMI E5-97.

  secsify subroutine

     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@sec_list);
     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@sec_list, @options);
     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@sec_list, [@options]);
     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@sec_list, {@options});

     $binary_secs = secsify( \@sec_list, type => 'binary');
     $binary_secs = secsify( \@sec_list, type => 'binary', @options);
     $binary_secs = secsify( \@sec_list, [type => 'binary',@options]);
     $binary_secs = secsify( \@sec_list, {type => 'binary',@options});

    The "secsify" subroutine/method walks a data structure and converts all
    underlying array and hash references to arrays by applying the
    'arrayify' subroutine/method.

    In this module, there are only three Perlified SECSII elements that will
    be listified into SECSII message as follows:

     OBJECT, INDEX OBJECT, and SCALAR

     OBJECT => 'L', $number-of-elements, 
               'A', $class,
               'A', $built-in-class,
               @elements

     @elements may contain a Perlified OBJECT, REFERENCE or SCALAR)

     INDEX OBJECT => 'L' '2', 'A' 'Index', 'U4', $number-of-indices, @indices 
 
     (reference is index into the nested list of lists)

     SCALAR = 'A', $scalar  (Perl built-in class)
                
  stringify subroutine

    The "stringify" subroutined stringifies a Perl data structure by
    applying the "listify" and "secify" subroutines.

  transify subroutine

     \@sec_list  = transify($acsii_secs);
     \@sec_list  = transify($acsii_secs, @options);
     \@sec_list  = transify($acsii_secs, [@options]);
     \@sec_list  = transify($acsii_secs, {@options});

    The "transify" subroutine takes a free style text consisting of list of
    secsii items and converts it to SECS list. The "transify" subroutine is
    very liberal in what it accepts as valid input.

    The number of body elements may be supplied either as enclosed in
    brackets of a "comma" after the unpacked format code. Text strings may
    be enclosed in parentheses, brackets, or any other character.

    The enclosing ending character may be escaped with the backslash '\'.
    List may be counted by suppling a count in either brackets or following
    a comma after the 'L' format character or by enclosing parentheseses,
    bracketers or any other character.

    The "transify" subroutine uses option {format => 'P'}, or {format =>
    'S'} as the value for the leading SECS list U1 format byte. SEMI E5-94
    SECII item.

    The return is either a reference to a SECS list or case of an error an
    error message. To determine an error from a SECS list , check if the
    return is a reference or a reference to an ARRAY.

  vectorize subroutine

     $error = vectorize( \@sec_list );

    The "vectorize" subroutine ensures that all the bodies in a SECS list
    for numeric items, format U, S, F, T, are references to an array of
    numbers.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script 'Secs2.t' found in the
    "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file verifies the requirements
    for this module.

    All testing software and documentation stems from the Software Test
    Description (STD) program module 't::Data::Secs2', found in the
    distribution file "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz".

    The 't::Data::Secs2' STD POD contains a tracebility matix between the
    requirements established above for this module, and the test steps
    identified by a 'ok' number from running the 'Secs2.t' test script.

    The t::Data::Secs2' STD program module '__DATA__' section contains the
    data to perform the following:

    *   to generate the test script 'Secs2.t'

    *   generate the tailored STD POD in the 't::Data::Secs2' module,

    *   generate the 'Secs2.d' demo script,

    *   replace the POD demonstration section herein with the demo script
        'Secs2.d' output, and

    *   run the test script using Test::Harness with or without the verbose
        option,

    To perform all the above, prepare and run the automation software as
    follows:

    *   Install "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz" from one of the
        respositories only if it has not been installed:

        *   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

        *   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    *   manually place the script tmake.pl in
        "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in the site operating system
        executable path only if it is not in the executable path

    *   place the 't::Data::Secs2' at the same level in the directory
        struture as the directory holding the 'Data::Secs2' module

    *   execute the following in any directory:

         tmake -test_verbose -replace -run -pm=t::Data::Secs2

NOTES
  FILES

    The installation of the "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file
    installs the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' SVD program module.

    The __DATA__ data section of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' contains
    all the necessary data to generate the POD section of
    'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' and the "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz"
    distribution file.

    To make use of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' SVD program module,
    perform the following:

    *   install "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz" from one of the
        respositories only if it has not been installed:

        *   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

        *   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    *   manually place the script vmake.pl in
        "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in the site operating system
        executable path only if it is not in the executable path

    *   Make any appropriate changes to the __DATA__ section of the
        'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' module. For example, any changes to
        'Data::Secs2' will impact the at least 'Changes' field.

    *   Execute the following:

         vmake readme_html all -pm=Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2

  3.3 Changes

    Changes to past revisions are as follows:

    Data-Strify-0.01
        Originated

    Data-Secs2-0.01
        Abandoned Data::Dumper in favor of SEMI E35, SECS-II, standard for
        stringifying Perl data.

    Data-Secs2-0.02
        Added arrayification of REF and GLOB references. Thus, the
        'Data::Secs2' module will nest into REF and GLOB references.

    Data-Secs2-0.03
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/Data, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

    Installation Instructions.
        To installed the release file, use the CPAN module pr PPM module in
        the Perl release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        If all else fails, the file may be manually installed. Enter one of
        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'Data-Secs2-0.03.tar.gz' and download to a temporary
        installation directory. Enter the following where $make is 'nmake'
        for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip Data-Secs2-0.03.tar.gz
         tar -xf Data-Secs2-0.03.tar
         perl Makefile.PL
         $make test
         $make install

        On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip must be in the
        exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are not install, download and
        install unxutils from

         http://packages.softwarediamonds.com

    Prerequistes.
         'Data::SecsPack' => '0.01',

    Security, privacy, or safety precautions.
        None.

    Installation Tests.
        Most Perl installation software will run the following test
        script(s) as part of the installation:

         t/Data/Secs2.t

    Installation support.
        If there are installation problems or questions with the
        installation contact

         603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    The only reason this exists is that it appears earlier versions of the
    'Data::Dumper' module, say version 2.102 and before, did not sort the
    hash keys.

    For at least 'Data::Dumper' version 2.12 there is a sort keys option and
    'Data::Dumper' should be used directly.
