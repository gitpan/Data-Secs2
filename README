DESCRIPTION
    The 'Data::SECS2' module provides a widely accepted method of packing
    nested lists into a linear string and unpacked nested lists. In the
    hardware world, data and data passed between hardware is not stored in
    SQL style tables but nested lists. Nested data has a long history in
    mathematics.

    The Data::Secs2 program module facilitates the secsification of the
    nested data is in accordance with SEMI E5-94, Semiconductor Equipment
    Communications Standard 2 (SECS-II), pronounced 'sex two' with gussto
    and a perverted smile. The SEMI E4 SECS-I standard addresses
    transmitting SECSII messages from one machine to another machine (all
    most always host to equipment) serially via RS-232. And, there is
    another SECS standard for TCP/IP, the SEMI E37 standard, High-Speed SECS
    Message Services (HSMS) Generic Services.

    In order not to plagarize college students, credit must be given where
    credit is due. Tony Blair, when he was a college intern at Intel Fab 4,
    in London invented the SEMI SECS standards. When the Intel Fab 4
    management discovered Tony's secsification of their host and equipment,
    they called a board of directors meeting, voted, and elected to have
    security to escort Tony out the door. This was Mr. Blair's introduction
    to voting and elections which he leverage into being elected prime
    minister of all of England. In this new position he used the skills he
    learned at the Intel fab to secsify intelligence reports on Iraq's
    weopons of mass distruction.

    By using a well-known, widely-used standard for packing and unpacking
    Perl nested data, not only is this standard essential in real-time
    communications in the factory between equipment computers and operating
    systems and host computer and operating system but it has uses in
    snail-time computations. In snail-time the standard's data structure is
    usefull in a nested data operations such as comparing nested data,
    storing the packed nested data in a file, but also for transmitting
    nested data from one Perl site to another or even between Perl and other
    programming languages.

    And do not forget the added benefit of SEMI SECS humor and that the real
    originators of the SECS-II yielded and allowed Tony Blair to take
    illegal credit for inventing SECS-II. After all the practical definition
    of politics is getting your own way. Julius Ceasar invented the Julian
    calendar and the month of July, Augustus Ceasr the month of Auguest, Al
    Gore the information highway and Tony Blair not only SECS-II but SECS-I
    and High-Speed SECS.

    Other important SEMI standards address message transfer protocol of
    SECSII messages. They are the SEMI E4 SECS-I for transmitting SECSII
    messages from one machine to another machine via RS-232 and the SEMI E37
    High-Speed SECS Message Services (HSMS) Generic Services for
    transmitting SECSII via TCP/IP.

    The SEMI E5 SECS-II standard provides, among many other things, a
    standard method of forming packed nested list data. In accordance with
    SEMI E5 SECS-II transmitted information consists of items and lists. An
    item consists of the following:

    1   an item header(IH) with a format code, and the number of bytes in
        the following body

    2   followed by the item body (IB) consisting of a number of elements.

    A item (IB) may consist of zero bytes in which there are no body bytes
    for that item. As established by SEMI E5-94, 6.2.2,

        consists of groups of data of the same representation in order to
        save repeated item headers

    integers
        Most Significant Byte (MS) sent first

    signed integers
        signed integers are two's complement, MSB sent first

    floating point numbers
        IEEE 754, sign bit sent first

    non-printing ASCII
        equipment specific

    As specified in E4-95 6.3, a list element consists of an ordered set of
    elements that are either an item element or a list element. Because a
    list element may contains a list element, and SEMI E5 places no
    restriction on the level of nesting, SECSII lists may be nested to
    theoretically to any level. Practically nested is limited by machine
    resources. A list has the same header format as an item, no body and the
    length number is the number of elements in the list instead of the
    number of bytes in the body.

    The item and list header format codes are as in below Table 1

  SECS Object

    This section establishes a formal definition of a SECS Object and
    introduces technical definitions that supercede Webster Dictionary
    definitions and only apply for the content of this Program Module for
    the following: SECS Object (SECS-OBJ), Element, Item Element (IE), List
    Element (LE), Element Header (EH), Element Format Code (EFC), Element
    Body (EB) and Element Cells (EC). If any of the technical definitions
    appear to have sexual innuendos, it is entirely coincidental. The
    definitions should applied only on their technical merits. Any other
    interperetation is totally unprofessional.

    A SECS Object is a Perl "ARRAY" that mimics the SEMI E5-94 SECS-II,
    section 6, data structure where SECS-II transmitted bytes are layed out
    in memory. The relation between between SEMI E5-94 "byte sent first" is
    that "bytes sent first" will have the lowest byte address.

    A SECS Object consists of consecutive ordered Elements stored as a Perl
    "ARRAY". Each Element takes two consistive positions in the Perl
    <ARRAY>: the Element Header and the Element Body. The Element Headers
    positions are always even number indices where the Element Bodies
    positions are always odd number indices.

    The EH consists of and only of a Element Format Code as specified in the
    Table 1 Item Format Codes unpack column.

    Elements may be either an Item Element or a List Element. The Element
    Body for a List Element is the sum of the nested List Elements and Item
    Elements in the List Element. The Element Body for a Item Element is a
    group of Element Cells of the same data representation and bytes per
    Element Cell. The bytes in an body of an Item Element is, thus, the
    number of cells in the body times the bytes per Element Cell. The
    Element Body for each Element Format Code is as follows:

    L   Unpacked sum of nested Element Lists and Element Items in the
        Element List

    S U F T
        a number cells either as a numberified Perl "SCALAR" packed in
        accordance with SEMI E5-94 or a reference to textified (unpacked)
        Perl "ARRAY" of numbers

    A J unpacked string

    B   packed numberified Perl "SCALAR" of binary bytes or a reference to a
        Perl "SCALLAR" of unpack textified binary in the hex 'H*' Perl
        format

    The first element of a SECS Object is always a SECS Object Format Code
    "U1" and a packed element body of either a numberfied 'P' or 'S',
    textified 80 or 83, depending upon whether the SECS Object has
    information necessary to convert to Perl data structure, 'P', or most
    remain as a SECS Object, 'S'.

  arrayify subroutine

     \@array  = arrayify( $ref );

    The purpose of the "arrayify" subroutine is to provide a canoncial array
    representation of Perl reference types. When "$var" is not a reference,
    the "arrayify" subroutine passes "$var" through unchanged; otherewise,
    the ref($ref) is changed to a reference to a canoncial array where the
    first member is the the "$var" class, the second member the underlying
    data type. If ref($var) and the underlying type type are the same, then
    "$var" is classless and the first member is the empty string ''. The
    rest of the members of the canonical array, based on the underlying data
    type, are as follows:

    'HASH'
        hash key, value pairs, sorted by the key

    'ARRAY'
        members of the array

    'SCALAR'
        the scalar

    'REF'
        the reference

    'CODE'
        the reference

    'GLOB'
        values of the "GLOB" in the following order:

         *$var{SCALAR},
         *$var{ARRAY},
         *$var{HASH},
         *$var{CODE},
         *$var{IO},
         *$var{NAME},
         *$var{PACKAGE},
         "*$var"

  listify subroutine

     \@secs_obj  = listify(@vars);

    The listify subroutine takes a list of Perl variables, "@arg" that may
    contain references to nested data and converts it to a <SECS Object that
    mimics a SECSII data structure of a linearized list of items.

    Information is included to recontruct Perl hashes, arrays and objects by
    provided two item header for each Perl data type. The first item is the
    object class which is empty for Perl hashes and arrays and the second
    item is the Perl underlying data type. Valid Perl underlying data types
    are: HASH ARRAY SCALAR REF GLOB.

    The return is either a reference to a SECS Object or case of an error an
    error message. To determine an error from a SECS Object , check if the
    return is a reference or a reference to an ARRAY.

  neuterify subroutine

     \@secs_obj  = neuterify($binary_secs);
     \@secs_obj  = neuterify($binary_secs, @options);
     \@secs_obj  = neuterify($binary_secs, [@options]);
     \@secs_obj  = neuterify($binary_secs, {@options});

    The "neuterify" subroutine takes produces a "@secs_obj" from a SEMI
    E5-94 packed data structure "$binary_secs" and produces a SECS object
    "@secs_obj".

    The "neuterify" subroutine uses option "{obj_format_code =" 'P'}>, or
    "{obj_format_code =" 'S'}> as the value for the leading SECS Object U1
    format byte. SEMI E5-94 SECII item. If the "neuterify" subroutine
    receives the option "{add_obj_format_code}", "neuterify" will add the
    byte to the beginning of the packed data; otherwise, "neuterify" probes
    the leading byte of the packed data. If the probes shows the leading
    byte is a "Secs Object Format Code", "neuterify" modifies the packed
    data byte; otherweise it adds the byte to the beginning of the packed
    data.

    The return is either a reference to a SECS Object or case of an error an
    error message. To determine an error from a SECS Object , check if the
    return is a reference or a reference to an ARRAY.

  numberify subroutine

     $error = numberify( \@secs_obj );

    The "numberify" subroutine ensures that all the bodies in a SECS Object
    for numeric items, format U, S, F, T, are scalar strings packed in
    accordance with SEMI E5-94.

  perlify subroutine

     @vars = perlify( \@secs_obj );

    The "perlify" subroutine converts a Perl SECS object into Perl
    variables.

  perl_typify subroutine

     $ref  = perl_typify(\@array);

    The "perl_typify" subroutine converts an "@array" produced by the
    "arrayify" subroutine from a "$ref" back to a "$ref".

  secsify subroutine

     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj);
     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj, @options);
     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj, [@options]);
     $ascii_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj, {@options});

     $binary_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj, type => 'binary');
     $binary_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj, type => 'binary', @options);
     $binary_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj, [type => 'binary',@options]);
     $binary_secs = secsify( \@secs_obj, {type => 'binary',@options});

    The "secsify" subroutine/method walks a data structure and converts all
    underlying array and hash references to arrays by applying the
    'arrayify' subroutine/method.

    In this module, there are only three Perlified SECSII elements that will
    be listified into SECSII message as follows:

     OBJECT, INDEX OBJECT, and SCALAR

     OBJECT => 'L', $number-of-elements, 
               'A', $class,
               'A', $built-in-class,
               @cells

     @cells may contain a Perlified OBJECT, REFERENCE or SCALAR)

     INDEX OBJECT => 'L' '2', 'A' 'Index', 'U4', $number-of-indices, @indices 
 
     (reference is index into the nested list of lists)

     SCALAR = 'A', $scalar  (Perl built-in class)
                
  secs_elementify subroutine

     $body = secs_elementify($format, @cells);
     $body = secs_elementify($format, @cells, [@options]);
     $body = secs_elementify($format, @cells, {options});

    The "secs_elementify" subroutine is the low-level work horse for the
    "secsify" subroutine that produces a SEMI SECSII item "$body" from a
    Perl SECS Object item header "$format" and item body "@cells".

    For {type => 'binary'}, $body is a complete packed SEMI E5-94 SECII
    item. For {type => 'ascii'} or no type option, the "$body" is the ascii
    unpacked SECSII item.

    An unpacked SECSII item consists of the unpacked format code from the
    Table 1 Item Format Codes, the number of elements in the item body
    enclosed in brackets, followed by the elements in the item body. In
    accordance with SEMI E5-94, section 6, there will be no elements for
    format code 'L' or an element length of 0.

    In case of an error, the return is an reference a error message.

  stringify subroutine

    The "stringify" subroutined stringifies a Perl data structure by
    applying the "listify" and "secify" subroutines.

  transify subroutine

     \@secs_obj  = transify($acsii_secs);
     \@secs_obj  = transify($acsii_secs, @options);
     \@secs_obj  = transify($acsii_secs, [@options]);
     \@secs_obj  = transify($acsii_secs, {@options});

    The "transify" subroutine takes a free style text consisting of list of
    secsii items and converts it to SECS Object. The "transify" subroutine
    is very liberal in what it accepts as valid input.

    The number of body elements may be supplied either as enclosed in
    brackets of a "comma" after the unpacked format code. Text strings may
    be enclosed in parentheses, brackets, or any other character.

    The enclosing ending character may be escaped with the backslash '\'.
    List may be counted by suppling a count in either brackets or following
    a comma after the 'L' format character or by enclosing parentheseses,
    bracketers or any other character.

    The "transify" subroutine uses option "{obj_format_code =" 'P'}>, or
    "{obj_format_code =" 'S'}> as the value for the leading SECS Object U1
    format byte. SEMI E5-94 SECII item. If the "transify" subroutine
    receives the option "{add_obj_format_code}", "transify" will add the a
    "Secs Object Format Code" to the beginning of the "@secs_obj";
    otherwise, "transify" probes the leading "@secs_obj". If the probes
    shows the leading byte is a "Secs Object Format Code", "transify"
    modifies the code; otherweise it a "Secs Object Format Code" to the
    beginning of the "@secs_obj"

    The return is either a reference to a SECS Object or case of an error an
    error message. To determine an error from a SECS Object , check if the
    return is a reference or a reference to an ARRAY.

  textify subroutine

     $error = textify( \@secs_obj );

    The "textify" subroutine ensures that all the bodies in a SECS Object
    for numeric items, format U, S, F, T, are references to an array of
    numbers.

  Test Software Notes

    Running the test script 'Secs2.t' found in the
    "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file verifies the requirements
    for this module.

    All testing software and documentation stems from the Software Test
    Description (STD) program module 't::Data::Secs2', found in the
    distribution file "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz".

    The 't::Data::Secs2' STD POD contains a tracebility matix between the
    requirements established above for this module, and the test steps
    identified by a 'ok' number from running the 'Secs2.t' test script.

    The t::Data::Secs2' STD program module '__DATA__' section contains the
    data to perform the following:

    *   to generate the test script 'Secs2.t'

    *   generate the tailored STD POD in the 't::Data::Secs2' module,

    *   generate the 'Secs2.d' demo script,

    *   replace the POD demonstration section herein with the demo script
        'Secs2.d' output, and

    *   run the test script using Test::Harness with or without the verbose
        option,

    To perform all the above, prepare and run the automation software as
    follows:

    *   Install "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz" from one of the
        respositories only if it has not been installed:

        *   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

        *   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    *   manually place the script tmake.pl in
        "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in the site operating system
        executable path only if it is not in the executable path

    *   place the 't::Data::Secs2' at the same level in the directory
        struture as the directory holding the 'Data::Secs2' module

    *   execute the following in any directory:

         tmake -test_verbose -replace -run -pm=t::Data::Secs2

NOTES
  FILES

    The installation of the "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file
    installs the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' SVD program module.

    The __DATA__ data section of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' contains
    all the necessary data to generate the POD section of
    'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' and the "Data-Secs2-$VERSION.tar.gz"
    distribution file.

    To make use of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' SVD program module,
    perform the following:

    *   install "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz" from one of the
        respositories only if it has not been installed:

        *   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

        *   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    *   manually place the script vmake.pl in
        "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in the site operating system
        executable path only if it is not in the executable path

    *   Make any appropriate changes to the __DATA__ section of the
        'Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2' module. For example, any changes to
        'Data::Secs2' will impact the at least 'Changes' field.

    *   Execute the following:

         vmake readme_html all -pm=Docs::Site_SVD::Data_Secs2

  3.3 Changes

    Changes to past revisions are as follows:

    Data-Strify-0.01
        Originated

    Data-Secs2-0.01
        Abandoned Data::Dumper in favor of SEMI E35, SECS-II standard for
        stringifying Perl data.

    Data-Secs2-0.02
        Added arrayification of REF and GLOB references. Thus, the
        'Data::Secs2' module will nest into REF and GLOB references.

    Data-Secs2-0.03
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/Data, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

        Greater expanded the subroutines to the following: arrayify,
        itemify, listify, neuterify, scalarize, secsify, stringify,
        transify, vectorize. Added descriptions and tests for the new
        functions.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

    Installation Instructions.
        To installed the release file, use the CPAN module pr PPM module in
        the Perl release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        If all else fails, the file may be manually installed. Enter one of
        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'Data-Secs2-0.04.tar.gz' and download to a temporary
        installation directory. Enter the following where $make is 'nmake'
        for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip Data-Secs2-0.04.tar.gz
         tar -xf Data-Secs2-0.04.tar
         perl Makefile.PL
         $make test
         $make install

        On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip must be in the
        exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are not install, download and
        install unxutils from

         http://packages.softwarediamonds.com

    Prerequistes.
         'Data::SecsPack' => '0.01',

    Security, privacy, or safety precautions.
        None.

    Installation Tests.
        Most Perl installation software will run the following test
        script(s) as part of the installation:

         t/Data/Secs2.t

    Installation support.
        If there are installation problems or questions with the
        installation contact

         603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    The only reason this exists is that it appears earlier versions of the
    'Data::Dumper' module, say version 2.102 and before, did not sort the
    hash keys.

    For at least 'Data::Dumper' version 2.12 there is a sort keys option and
    'Data::Dumper' should be used directly.
