  3.7 Possible problems and known errors
    The only reason this exists is that it appears earlier versions of the
    'Data::Dumper' module, say version 2.102 and before, did not sort the
    hash keys.

    For at least 'Data::Dumper' version 2.12 there is a sort keys option and
    'Data::Dumper' should be used directly.
