=head2 3.3 Changes

Changes to past revisions are as follows: 

=over 4

=item Data-Strify-0.01

Originated

=item Data-Secs2-0.01

Abandoned Data::Dumper in favor of SEMI E35,
SECS-II standard for stringifying Perl data.

=item Data-Secs2-0.02

Added arrayification of REF and GLOB references.
Thus, the 'Data::Secs2' module will nest into
REF and GLOB references.

=item Data-Secs2-0.03

The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the same
directory as the test script.
Coordiated with the lastest Test::STDmaker by moving the
test library from tlib to t/Data, the same directory as the test script
and deleting the test library File::TestPath program module.

=item Data-Secs2-0.04

Greater expanded the subroutines to the following: arrayify, itemify, 
listify, neuterify, scalarize, secsify, stringify, transify, vectorize.
Added descriptions and tests for the new functions.

=item Data-Secs2-0.05

Change Perlify to allow translation packed multi-cell number item elements
as number arrays. Single cell number item elements are still translated
as a number scalar. This situation exists because SEMI E5 treats a
single text character and a single number as a cell, while Perl treats
multiple characters and a single number as a scalar. Granted
there is the Perl function C<vec> that allows some manipulation
of multicell data. But it is stretch to say that because of the 
C<vec> function that multicell integers are an underlying Perl data
type.

Added C<new> and C<config> subroutine to supply the default, (startup)
options for each subroutine in the C<Data::Secs2> program module.
The default options may be overriden with a subroutine input for
most subroutines.

The Perl undef was not finding a home in the SECS2 Object. Found a home
as a SEMI E5-94 empty list L[0].

Added support for the C<CODE> underlying Perl data type.

=item Data-Secs2-0.06

Changed the definition of a C<SECS Object>, eliminating the option of have
numbers packed or unpacked to unpack only. Replaced the slot for packed
with a new encoding of a 'Numeric Scalar'. 
Perl does not  support 'Test Scalars' while the SEMI E5-94 standard does not 
support neither scalars. Other languages, such as APL, support nested array,
'Text Scalars' and 'Numeric Scalars'.

BEFORE: (Data-Secs2-0.05)

 U1
 [1 2 3] # unpacked

 U1
 $*%  # packed


AFTER: (Data-Secs2-0.06)

 U1
 [1 2 3]  # numeric array

 U1
 1  # numeric scalar

 A
 'hello'  # text array

 A
 'h' # text scalar

Note that altough text scalars are possible and exist in other
languages, the C<Data::Secs2> program module
does not provide support for them.
In Perl what other languages consider text arrays are text scalars.
Since underlying Perl language does not
support them, they are not part of common Perl practices, and
turning Perl text arrays into text scalars and introducing
text arrays require extensive gyrations to Perl.

Added a new format type to C<SECS Object> with unspecified
bytes per cell, format 'N', where the 'N' stands for number.
Eliminated the C<textify> and C<numerify> subroutines that
packed and unpacked C<SECS Object> numeric data. It is always
unpacked for C<Data-Secs2>. Eliminated the C<perl_secs_numbers>
for the C<listify> subroutine. Since have a crystal clear encoding
of scalar numberics and scalar arrays (lists), Perl numeric arrays will
always be encoded as 'multicell' when going form Perl nested lists to
C<SECS Object>.

Changed the output of the C<perlify> subroutine from a list of
variables to a reference to a list of variables and introduced
a scalar as an error message. This allows another way to
output error messages beside optional C<warns> and C<dies>.

=item Data-Secs2-0.07

The C<secs_elementify> subroutine did not handle a numeric zero properly.
Added test for numeric zero and undef.

=head2 3.4 Adaptation data.

This installation requires that the installation site
has the Perl programming language installed.
There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of 
configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
installation particular to any installation site.

=head2 3.5 Related documents.

There are no related documents needed for the installation and
test of this release.

=head2 3.6 Installation instructions.

Instructions for installation, installation tests
and installation support are as follows:

=over 4

=item Installation Instructions.

To installed the release file, use the CPAN module
pr PPM module in the Perl release
or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

 http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

If all else fails, the file may be manually installed.
Enter one of the following repositories in a web browser:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

Right click on 'Data-Secs2-0.07.tar.gz' and download to a temporary
installation directory.
Enter the following where $make is 'nmake' for microsoft
windows; otherwise 'make'.

 gunzip Data-Secs2-0.07.tar.gz
 tar -xf Data-Secs2-0.07.tar
 perl Makefile.PL
 $make test
 $make install

On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip 
must be in the exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are
not install, download and install unxutils from
